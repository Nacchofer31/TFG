  abstract   = {Developing applications targeting mobile devices is a complex task involving numerous options, technologies, and trade-offs, mostly due to the proliferation and fragmentation of devices and platforms. As a result of this, cross-platform app development has enjoyed the attention of practitioners and academia for the previous decade. Throughout this review, we assess the academic body of knowledge and report on the state of research on the field. We do so with a particular emphasis on core concepts, including those of user experience, device features, performance, and security. Our findings illustrate that the state of research demand for empirical verification of an array of unbacked claims, and that a particular focus on qualitative user-oriented research is essential. Through our outlined taxonomy and state of research overview, we identify research gaps and challenges, and provide numerous suggestions for further research.},

  abstract  = {Mobile applications usually need to be provided for more than one operating system. Developing native apps separately for each platform is a laborious and expensive undertaking. Hence, cross-platform approaches have emerged, most of them based on Web technologies. While these enable developers to use a single code base for all platforms, resulting apps lack a native look & feel. This, however, is often desired by users and businesses. Furthermore, they have a low abstraction level. We propose MD2, an approach for model-driven cross-platform development of apps. With MD2, developers specify an app in a high-level (domain-specific) language designed for describing business apps succinctly. From this model, purely native apps for Android and iOS are automatically generated. MD2 was developed in close cooperation with industry partners and provides means to develop data-driven apps with a native look and feel. Apps can access the device hardware and interact with remote servers.},
